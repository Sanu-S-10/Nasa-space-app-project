Stellar Stories: Space Weather Through the Eyes of Earthlings
Project Preview
This project explores the fascinating world of space weather and its profound effects on life and technology on Earth. It introduces space weather as the ever-changing environment surrounding the Sun, Earth, and the solar system, driven by powerful phenomena like solar wind, flares, and coronal mass ejections.

Key highlights include:

Understanding the Sun's role in generating space weather

Explaining magnetic storms, charged particles, and their impact on satellites, power grids, navigation, and astronaut safety

Real-world examples such as the Carrington Event (1859), the Quebec Blackout (1989), and the effects on military technology and infrastructure

Insights into how future deep-space missions (to the Moon and Mars) must tackle space weather risksâ€”like the need for heavy radiation shielding and robust predictive models

By bringing together scientific insights and historical case studies, the project aims to make space weather accessible and engaging.
